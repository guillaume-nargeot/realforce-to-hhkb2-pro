realforce-to-hhkb2-pro
======================

AutoHotKey configuration simulating Happy Hacking Keyboard 2 Pro key mapping on a Topre Realforce 89s.

The script also disables all the keys whih are not available on the HHKB, and provides the following additional mappings:
- Fn pressed and released alone is mapped to Enter,
- muhenkan and KANA are equivalent to Backspace.

Possible improvements:
- if the Fn key is pressed alone, held for more than 500ms and then released, it should not be considered Enter.
